## Introduction

This project involves the navigation of a free-flying Astrobee within the International Space Station (ISS). Each team embarked on a journey to address complex navigation challenges within the confines of the ISS environment. Their focus encompassed trajectory optimization, obstacle avoidance, and robust computer vision algorithms to ensure precise navigation and operation of the Astrobee.

## Project Scope

The project took place from June 1, 2022, to July 25, 2022. It was undertaken as part of the 3rd Kibo Robot Programming Challenge hosted by JAXA in collaboration with NASA. Since the challenge at the time was not open to non-Kibo-ABC countries, the Tunisian Space Association (TUNSA) arranged an agreement with the JAXA to allow a number of teams from Tunisia to participate in collaboration with other teams from Kibo-ABC countries. Eventually, 7 Tunisian teams, 5-members each, were able to participate in the challenge, each led by a member from TUNSA Space Robotics. This repository houses the source code and APKs submitted during the competition for 2 teams: Genesis_x_Spacebeat and Prime_x_Bondowoso3. It also contains the programming resources that were used throughout the challenge.

## Technical Details

- **Optimized Trajectory and Obstacle Avoidance**: Enhanced navigation efficiency by optimizing Astrobee trajectory and obstacle avoidance algorithms, resulting in a 48% reduction in mission completion time.
- **Target Localization and Laser Shooting**: Implemented robust OpenCV algorithms for locating and laser shooting circular targets in the ISS Kibo module, achieving a 33% improvement in team scores.
- **Improved Laser Alignment**: Enhanced laser alignment with fixed and dynamic targets by 24% through iterative estimation of 3D coordinates of ArUco markers and reverse-transforming them to the robot frame.
- **Efficient Java Functions**: Implemented 8 essential Java functions for efficient matrix multiplication, vector computations, quaternion-to-Euler conversion, and OpenCV's Hough gradient method for circle detection.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Set up the necessary development environment, including Java Development Kit (JDK) and Android Studio.
2. Install OpenCV library and configure it with the Android Studio project.
3. Build the project and export the APK

### Usage

1. Upload the APK to the dedicated page on the Kibo-RPC competition website.
2. Launch the simulation environment of the ISS provided by JAXA.
3. Monitor real-time feedback from the Astrobee's cameras and sensors.
4. Execute navigation tasks and observe system performance in simulated and actual environments.
