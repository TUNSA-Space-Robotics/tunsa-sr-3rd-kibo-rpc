# Navigation of a Free-Flying Astrobee within the ISS

### TUNSA Space Robotics

**Technologies:** Java, Android Studio, OpenCV, ArUco, Image Processing, Object Tracking, Trajectory Planning, Camera Projection, Visual Servoing

## Introduction

This project was undertaken as part of the 3rd Kibo Robot Programming Challenge hosted by JAXA in collaboration with NASA. It involved the navigation of a free-flying Astrobee within the International Space Station (ISS). Leveraging advanced technologies and programming methodologies, our team tackled challenges in trajectory optimization and computer vision to ensure precise navigation and operation of the Astrobee.

## Project Scope

The project took place from June 1, 2022, to July 25, 2022. As the lead programmer, I spearheaded a team of 5 members to address complex navigation challenges within the confines of the ISS environment. Our focus encompassed trajectory optimization, obstacle avoidance, and robust computer vision algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Trajectory and Obstacle Avoidance**: Enhanced navigation efficiency by optimizing Astrobee trajectory and obstacle avoidance algorithms, resulting in a 48% reduction in mission completion time.
- **Target Localization and Laser Shooting**: Implemented robust OpenCV algorithms for locating and laser shooting circular targets in the ISS Kibo module, achieving a 33% improvement in team scores.
- **Improved Laser Alignment**: Enhanced laser alignment with fixed and dynamic targets by 24% through iterative estimation of 3D coordinates of ArUco markers and reverse-transforming them to the robot frame.
- **Efficient Java Functions**: Implemented 8 essential Java functions for efficient matrix multiplication, vector computations, quaternion-to-Euler conversion, and OpenCV's Hough gradient method for circle detection.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Set up the necessary development environment, including Java Development Kit (JDK) and Android Studio.
2. Install OpenCV library and configure it with the Android Studio project.
3. Ensure compatibility with the target platform and hardware devices.

### Usage

1. Launch the application on the designated platform within the ISS environment.
2. Monitor real-time feedback from the Astrobee's cameras and sensors.
3. Execute navigation tasks and observe system performance in simulated and actual environments.
